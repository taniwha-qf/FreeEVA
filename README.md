This is a very simple plugin to allow control of KSP's automatic
orientation of the kerbal to always face away from the camera with the
kerbal's head pointed camera-up (North? +norm for Orbital, +rad for Free).
As a result, getting onto a ladder in orbit can go from frustratingly
nigh-on impossible to mildly confusing until one gets used to the freedom.

Note that is this plugin does nothing other than toggle the
EVA_ROTATE_ON_MOVE, all issues with EVA controls lie solely with KSP
itself. However, toggling the mode in the vicinity of a ladder or hatch may
have unintended consequences.

To toggle the mode, simply press LeftAlt-F (this applies to Linux users,
too (I am one)). The current status will be displayed for about three
seconds in green in the upper center of the screen (like timewarp).

Review of EVA controls (well known controls included for completeness):
LeftAlt-F: Toggle free EVA mode (added by this mod)
F: Interact with ladders/hatches.
L: Toggle helmet lights.
R: Toggle RCS (RCS must be on for /any/ of the following to work)
W/S: Move forward/back
A/D: Move left/right
Q/E: Turn left/right (does not work when walking)
left mouse button drag: trackball-rotate
Space: Reset the kerbal's orientation: facing away from the camera with the
kerbal's head pointing up. Also let go of a ladder or jump.
